# About us
fibonhack is a CTF team born after [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/) 2019 by a group of students from [UniPi](https://www.unipi.it/). 
We are interested in computer security, but no we can't hack your friend's Facebook account

Check out how good (bad) we are doing at [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/team/117538)
