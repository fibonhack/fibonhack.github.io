We have some exciting news to share! The Fibonhack team is thrilled to announce the success of our first-ever [Capture The Flag (CTF) event](https://ctftime.org/event/1855/). It was a fantastic experience!

During the qualifications round, participants from all over impressed us with their incredible hacking skills and creative problem-solving abilities. We were truly impressed by their out-of-the-box thinking. If you're curious, you can find the source code for the challenges on [GitHub](https://github.com/fibonhack/ifctf-2023-quals-challs).

Now, let's talk about what's coming up next. We can't wait for the finals, the highlight of our CTF event. The finals will take place during the upcoming Internet Festival in Pisa! The festival's atmosphere and excitement will only add to the thrill of the CTF finals. 

We want to give a big shoutout to our sponsor, RJCSoft. Your support has been invaluable in making this event a reality. Thank you!

So, stay tuned for more updates and details about the finals. It's going to be an unforgettable event!

Stay awesome,

The Fibonhack Team
