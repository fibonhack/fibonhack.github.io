Guess what? We've pulled off something awesome! The Fibonhack team is super stoked to announce that we've successfully organized our very first [Capture The Flag (CTF) event](https://ctftime.org/event/1855/). Woohoo!

The qualifications round was an absolute blast. We witnessed some mind-blowing hacking skills and creativity from participants all over. Seriously, you folks blew us away with your problem-solving prowess and out-of-the-box thinking. We couldn't be more impressed! We also just published the source code for the challenges on [GitHub](https://github.com/fibonhack/ifctf-2023-quals-challs).

Now, let's talk about what's next. We're eagerly waiting for the finals, the epic climax of our CTF extravaganza. The anticipation is killing us! We've got some surprises in store for you, and trust us, it's going to be worth the wait.

Hold onto your keyboards because the finals will be happening soon. We're working hard to make sure it's a knockout experience for everyone involved. We've got an awesome venue lined up!

Oh, and here's another exciting update: the finals will be taking place during the upcoming Internet Festival in Pisa! How cool is that? The vibes, the energy, and the excitement of the festival will only add to the adrenaline-fueled CTF finals. We can't wait!


We want to give a huge shoutout to our amazing sponsor, RJCSoft. Your support means the world to us, and we're grateful for your involvement in making this event a reality. Thank you!

So, hang tight, keep sharpening your hacking skills, and get ready for the grand finale. We'll be back with more updates and all the juicy details about the finals. It's going to be one for the books, folks!

Stay awesome and stay tuned!
