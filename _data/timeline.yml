    A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” 
    (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section 
    in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
